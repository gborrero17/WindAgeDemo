                                Because of the high-temperature liquid salt transmission
                                medium, this plant can operate up to 16 hours a day, even though it depends on solar
                                power. This extended operation depends on well-insulated pipework and molds, and that
                                most of the personnel operating the plant will reside
                                within its borders, resting and sleeping in the same shipping containers in which the
                                plant equipment arrived. These containers are fitted with pipe berths that swing down
                                from the inner container sides, and each can accommodate
                                10-12 persons. Because of the human treadmill, a new crew of Users will have to rest
                                after approximately 1 hour. This plant is intended to offer security for its personnel
                                through a fence and only two gates. Only inspected
                                and approved pre-sorted plastic will be allowed to enter. The intent of the plant is to
                                create plastic building materials as its sole output. In this regard, three plastic
                                injection molds will focus on making standard-sized
                                blocks that mimic concrete blocks, half-blocks, and headers for above doors and windows.
                                These construction materials can be easily handled by one person, especially since they
                                will be much lighter than the original concrete
                                materials. During construction of a wall for a small house, a bead of glue will
                                typically be laid down before each block is tapped into place. 
                                
                                Human Treadmills: Each of
                                two human treadmills in the plant enables the rotational
                                force of up to 6 persons to be captured. In recorded history, treadmill cranes have been
                                used to load and unload cargo ships, and lift large stone blocks up cathedral walls, so
                                their use in high-torque applications is well
                                documented. This device fits well with plastic shredding, in which high torque is more
                                valuable than high RPMs.
                                <br><br> Because the treadmills are staggered along two shafts, each shaft can use
                                multiple drums to which wide belts and clutches can be attached, to run the plant’s
                                auxiliary devices such as washers, label removers, and driers.
                                Also, one of the power-takeoff drum belts can help turn the hydraulic booster pump at
                                the injection molding site, for increased pressure.<br><br> Each treadmill has an oval
                                opening in its outside surface that enables User ingress
                                and egress. When the treadmill stops, the tired crew exits from one end and a rested
                                crew comes aboard from the other. An operator outside the treadmill stops and starts it
                                via the drum-mounted clutches, which also act as brakes.

                                <br><br> Solar Panels: An array of concave mirrors focuses the sun’s rays on a small
                                area at the top of the concentrating solar tower, enabling the liquid salt transfer
                                medium to reach 1100-1500 degrees F, which is well beyond
                                the melting point of most plastics at 600-800 degrees F. This high temperature
                                compensates for unavoidable heat loss, and still enables the plastic to remain in a
                                plasma state through the night. Special computer algorithms
                                move the panels via small electric motors to focus the sunlight on a small area at the
                                top of the tower as the sun traverses the sky. An array of conventional photovoltaic
                                (PV) solar panels provides backup electrical power
                                to enable the use of cell phones, micro-wave ovens, small water pumps, refrigerators,
                                solar mirror/panel alignment, and plant lighting. delete:Special computer algorithms
                                pivot the PV panels via small electric motors to maintain
                                an ideal angle to the sun. A small battery bank and an inverter enable AC/DC power for
                                the crew to work at night.<br><br> 
                                
                                Concentrating Solar Tower: This tower is
                                pre-assembled, and limited to 40 feet in length so that it fits
                                within a conventional shipping container. On site, only the liquid salt pipework needs
                                to be connected once the tower is raised.<br><br> 
                                
                               
                            Pipework: Pipes to carry 1100-1500
                                degrees F liquid salt and wrap around the injection
                                molds are of titanium, to withstand the heat. When the proper temperature is reached,
                                the mold is directly fed shredded plastic pellets at its hopper, so there is no problem
                                with plastic hardening up within pipework.
                                
                                Injection
                                molds: As mentioned, three separate molds will produce standard-size plastic blocks,
                                half blocks, and headers for windows and doors. Each block has both projections and
                                hollows to facilitate quick and secure assembly by unskilled
                                laborers. Each mold is well insulated and wrapped by both liquid salt pipework and
                                cooling water pipework. After the plastic is injected, the water facilitates the removal
                                of the newly-cast block by quickly cooling it.
                                
                                Ramps and Stairs: These are made from local materials once the plant is unloaded and set up.
                                Typically, two workers will push a trolley load of pre-sorted plastic pieces up a ramp
                                and dump it at the top, into the topmost shredder.
                                A worker on the stairs, opposite the ramp, will rake all the pieces out of the trolley.
                                <br><br>
                                
                                Shredders: Shredders are of a conventional off-the-shelf design, with multiple
                                teeth, and stacked in this application so that the output of the top device falls out
                                and is further shredded by the device below it before
                                collection. The bottom shredder is driven by a belt off the otherwise unused second
                                shaft of the top shredder. Material can be put through this process again until it meets
                                the pellet size requirements of the injection molds.<br><br>
                                
                                Portability: Once the local
                                area is cleaned of unwanted plastic, the plant is broken down and loaded into the
                                resident shipping containers once more, to travel by truck to a new area contaminated by
                                plastic. -->
