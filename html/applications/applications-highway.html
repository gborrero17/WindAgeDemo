                inner-city recharging points, TDWGs mounted to selected overpasses use short cable runs to recharge
                alternate-power-source cars in nearby, dedicated parking lots. Power from the bank of TDWGs goes first
                to a Controller and then to a Battery Bank. From this Bank all-electric and hybrid cars are recharged
                directly; power from this DC Bank also goes to a third housing in which electrolysis takes place, making
                hydrogen from water for fuel-cell vehicles. This onsite production mitigates some of the major technical
                difficulties and safety issues involved with shipping and storing hydrogen. Distributed hydrogen access
                is an especially attractive option for some travelers, since fuel-cell vehicles can recharge from a
                pressurized hydrogen source much quicker than typical electric vehicles can recharge their batteries.
                Any excess DC power is inverted to AC and sent to the local grid and utility company, which is compelled
                by law to purchase it.'>

                kill time than to simultaneously get healthier, lose weight, and get paid for it? With the addition of a
                HumaGen Park to the TDWG System mix, communities can harvest and efficiently use the outputs of 3
                integrated sources of clean, distributed DC energy: wind from overpass-mounted TDWGs, roof-mounted PV
                solar panels, and human-generated power. Although the sun, wind, and traffic are somewhat intermittent,
                human energy harvesters can provide a significant and somewhat more predictable backup power source, all
                the while maintaining an ideal DC-to-DC efficiency. Users of the HumaGen Park can choose to have their
                own cars charged with the energy they produce or, if they have no such vehicles, opt to get a periodic
                rebate for their inverted clean energy from the local utility company--which is compelled by law to
                purchase it. Parents can bring their children to this park to play in the central area, and keep them
                constantly in sight while they all take exercise. In addition, these HumaGen Parks can be placed within
                existing rest stop grounds to enable long-distance travelers to maintain fitness during a trip.'>
