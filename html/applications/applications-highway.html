Highways
WindAge TDWG Highway Self-Standing Structures ApplicationIndependently of overpasses, TDWGs can be installed every 20 to 30 feet on dedicated mounting structures as are normally used to mount Interstate highway informational signs. The output from these units can power rest stops, roadside lighting, digital Amber Alert signs, or be sent to the local grid in what is commonly called a "Community Wind" program.

Highway Overpasses

WindAge TDWG Highway Overpass ApplicationWindAge TDWG Highway Overpass Application
Overpasses provide cost-effective mounting surfaces for WindAge TDWG Rotor Assemblies because they:

require no new construction or costs;
are sufficiently strong;
lend themselves to ducting;
are in close proximity to secondary roads and associated parking lots suitable for recharging;
are administered by the state rather than the federal government, which can foster community energy harvesting and commitment;
offer protection from rain, snow, ice, and tornadoes.
The most suitable overpass candidates will be oriented to capture the local ambient / prevailing wind.

Overpass + TDWG + Car Recharging Park
WindAge TDWG Highway Overpass and Recharging ApplicationIn order to dramatically expand easy access to inner-city recharging points, TDWGs mounted to selected overpasses use short cable runs to recharge alternate-power-source cars in nearby, dedicated parking lots. Power from the bank of TDWGs goes first to a Controller and then to a Battery Bank. From this Bank all-electric and hybrid cars are recharged directly; power from this DC Bank also goes to a third housing in which electrolysis takes place, making hydrogen from water for fuel-cell vehicles. This onsite production mitigates some of the major technical difficulties and safety issues involved with shipping and storing hydrogen. Distributed hydrogen access is an especially attractive option for some travelers, since fuel-cell vehicles can recharge from a pressurized hydrogen source much quicker than typical electric vehicles can recharge their batteries. Any excess DC power is inverted to AC and sent to the local grid and utility company, which is compelled by law to purchase it.

Overpass +TDWG + Car Recharging Park + HumaGen Park
WindAge TDWG Highway Overpass, Recharging & Humagen ApplicationMany alternate-power vehicle drivers away from home will eventually want to "kill" some time while their cars are recharging. What better way to kill time than to simultaneously get healthier, lose weight, and get paid for it? With the addition of a HumaGen Park to the TDWG System mix, communities can harvest and efficiently use the outputs of 3 integrated sources of clean, distributed DC energy: wind from overpass-mounted TDWGs, roof-mounted PV solar panels, and human-generated power. Although the sun, wind, and traffic are somewhat intermittent, human energy harvesters can provide a significant and somewhat more predictable backup power source, all the while maintaining an ideal DC-to-DC efficiency. Users of the HumaGen Park can choose to have their own cars charged with the energy they produce or, if they have no such vehicles, opt to get a periodic rebate for their inverted clean energy from the local utility company--which is compelled by law to purchase it. Parents can bring their children to this park to play in the central area, and keep them constantly in sight while they all take exercise. In addition, these HumaGen Parks can be placed within existing rest stop grounds to enable long-distance travelers to maintain fitness during a trip.

Clustered TDWGs Outside Interstate Rest Stop
WindAge TDWG Highway Self-Standing Structures ApplicationTrucks and buses contribute the most to TDWG energy harvesting due to their large size, and there is virtually no limit to the number of TDWGs which can be placed in series.

Interstate Highway Rest Stops
WindAge TDWG Highway Rest Stop Application
WindAge TDWG Highway Adaptable Self-Standing Structure Application
Whether powering the facilities at a rest stop or recharging alternate-fuel vehicles, TDWGs positioned near Interstate rest stops can provide the juice! Any excess DC power produced can be inverted to AC and sent to the local grid. No longer will one of the only arguments against electric vehicles (EVs) be valid--their limited range--since virtually all Interstate Highway rest stops are within current normal EV ranges of 50 miles. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles can also recharge at these rest stops, and these vehicles offer the option of even faster charging times.

After an initial period of TDWG use and acceptance for commercial vehicles, multiple lanes can be height restricted and separated with concrete barriers for short distances to allow ALL vehicles to produce clean energy. Advance warning of these special sections of road can be made well in advance with appropriate signage, as well as using flashing lights or other alarms for those vehicles not within height compliance. The same rebate system initially planned for transponder-equipped trucks and buses can extend to the general driving population, and drivers of all vehicles suitably equipped can be compensated for the energy they produce.

Imagine all clean vehicles of the future producing clean energy while they advance from A to B, and getting paid for it!
